## variables.  The function converts the selected ncdf file into a
## table with four columns: lon, lat, year, and projected.yield. NAs

## tool using the second generation of the GGCMI runs, but it is kept for legacy.

## read.AgMIP.RData: Function to read yield data (relative changes in
## percent compared with the reference period 1983-2013) from the
## second generation of GGCMI runs provided by Jonas JÃ¤germeyr on June
## 01, 2022. The function produces a dataset with four columns
## ("lon","lat","time","value"). "time" are all the years in the
## dataset (2016:2099), and value are the relative yields for
## crop. The data is ready to be aggregated geographically by
## grid.agg, which merges the lon/lat variables to a lower resolution,
## and allows for production or area weights.
#########################################################################

## The function takes two arguments: file and crop

## file: Character string with the name of a RData file provided by
## Jonas (may include a path address), for example
## "../data/dssat-pythia_gfdl-esm4_ssp126_default_production_and_yield_grid.RData".
## Each RData object data has three arrays of dimensions 720x360x84x5
## [lon x lat x 84 years (2016:2099) x 5 crops (mai, wwh, swh, soy,
## ric)]. The arrays are "yield_grid", "yield_grid_ir",
## "yield_grid_rf". "yield_grid" combines rainfed (rf) and irrigated
## (ir) yields, using area weights--"yield_grid" will be the dataset
## we wiill use. All the yields are relative changes in percent
## compared with the reference period 1983-2013:


## crop: one of maize, winter wheat, spring wheat, soybeans, rice
